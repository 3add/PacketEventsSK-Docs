# Configuration for server admins

PacketEventsSK has a few configuration options to change how it functions. These options can be set in the `./plugins/PacketEventsSK/config.yml` file.

## Default `config.yml` file

The default `config.yml` is shown below:

::: details **config.yml**
```yaml
# Welcome to PacketEventsSK v1.1.4

# If you have any questions, please first refer to the wiki:
# - https://github.com/3add/PacketEventsSK/wiki

# Enable this to automatically check for updates
update-checker:
  # If the update checker should be enabled at all
  enabled: true

  # If the update checker should run asynchronously or on the main thread
  async: false

# This config section contains all configurable syntax elements
# that PacketEventsSK contains.
elements:
  # General Elements cannot be turned on/off,
  # they contain events, packet builder and other basic features

  # Simple Elements are defined by being "hard coded" by me,
  # they contain stuff like, setting the skin of a player or setting a glow state.
  # these elements will always be hard to code in manually through general elements
  # and thus this simplicity has been provided to you.
  simple: true

  # Entity Elements are defined by using the EntityLib dependency,
  # they contain all "fake" entity building features
  entity: true
```
